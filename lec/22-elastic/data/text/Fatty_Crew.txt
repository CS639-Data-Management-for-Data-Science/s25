'''Fatty Crew''', or  '''Fatty Crew Hospitality Group''', is a restaurant group based in [[New York City]]. Member restaurants include '''Fatty Crab''', '''Fatty 'Cue''', and '''Pig and Khao'''. It is founded by Rick Camac and [[Zak Pelaccio|Zakary Pelaccio]].

== History ==
Pelaccio's first restaurant, the Chickenbone Cafe, was relatively short-lived, opening and closing in 2003.<ref name = "Fatty 'Cue Review">{{cite web|title=A Roadhouse With a World View|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/dining/reviews/fatty-cue-nyc-restaurant-review.html|accessdate=11 July 2013|author=Eric Asimov|work=New York Times}}</ref> Following that, he performed a short stint in 5 Ninth, but eventually left and founded Fatty Crew with Rick Camac. Their flagship restaurant, Fatty Crab, opened in 2005. As of 2017 every project managed or owned by Fatty Crew has closed.

With a restaurant that has been "full nearly since the minute it opened," <ref name = "Fatty Crab Review">{{cite web|title=Sopping Up Malaysian Sauces Downtown|url=http://events.nytimes.com/2005/10/26/dining/reviews/26unde.html|work=New York Times|author=Peter Meehan|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref> Pelaccio and Camac set out to expand their group into different cuisine styles, opening two Fatty 'Cue restaurants in West Village and Brooklyn.

Recently, Fatty Crew partnered with Top Chef contestant Leah Cohen to open up Pig and Khao, and Fatty Crab opened a new location in Hong Kong. Fatty Crew also explored several other side projects, including a partnership with [[Kardashian]] member Scott Disick in Ryu, a restaurant in the meatpacking district.<ref>{{cite web|title = That Kardashianâ€“Fatty Crew Restaurant Gets a Name|url=http://www.grubstreet.com/2012/04/scott-disick-restaurant-new-york-ryu.html|accessdate=17 July 2013|author=Alan Sytsma|publisher=New York Magazine}}</ref>

All of the Fatty Crew restaurants have since closed as of 2017 and the management deal with Leah Cohen is over after a heated legal dispute.
