'''Kennedy Fried Chicken''' and '''Crown Fried Chicken''' are common [[restaurant]] names primarily in the [[New York (state)|New York]]–[[New Jersey]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Delaware]] and [[Baltimore]] areas of the United States, but also in nearby smaller cities or towns along the [[Northeastern United States]]. Kennedy Fried Chickens typically compete with [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]] (KFC) in low income neighborhoods of several states along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. There are also a number in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], primarily in [[California]].  A number of these restaurants, located in other states, are named '''New York Fried Chicken,''' essentially designed in the same manner and offering the same general menu as Kennedy and Crown Fried Chicken. It is not an actual franchise in the typical manner; every "Kennedy" named chicken restaurant is independently owned and operated by different individuals but consist of essentially the same menu.

== History ==
Kennedy Fried Chicken was founded on May 16, 1969, with its first restaurant on [[Nostrand Avenue]] in the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] section of [[Brooklyn]]. There is a dispute among the people involved in the business over who is the actual founder. Some claim that it is Abdul Karim while others say Taeb Zia was the early founder. Zia, an [[Afghan American|Afghan immigrant]] originally from [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], is known by some as ''Zia Chicken'' or "Lau Chicken".<ref name=Bilefsky/> After studying engineering in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], he immigrated to the United States in 1977 and began working at a New York City [[fast food restaurant]] chain by the name of [[Kansas Fried Chicken]], founded by African-American entrepreneur [[Horace Bullard]].<ref name="JLS">{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Julian Lincoln |date=1999 |title=The economic consequences of immigration |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=United States |isbn=0-472-08616-2 |volume=2 |page=224 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yWFIIzBfhAC |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> After spending about three years learning how to run a fast food business, he decided to open his own fried chicken restaurant with equivalent quality but prices 15-20% cheaper.<ref name="JLS" />

Kennedy Fried Chicken  was named after assassinated [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], "because [[Demography of Afghanistan|Afghans]] are fond of the former president."<ref name="JLS" /><ref name=Bilefsky/> During the 1980s and 1990s many of the same restaurants have opened across New Jersey, New York, [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]] and several other states, including West Coast states such as [[California]].

==The restaurants==
For the most part the restaurants share the same concept, if not the same menus. In addition to [[fried chicken]] they may offer [[fried fish]], [[hot wings]], [[short ribs]], [[shrimp]], [[Hamburger|burgers]], [[pizza]], [[Jamaican patty|beef patties]] on [[coco bread]], sandwiches, [[French fries|fries]], [[corn on the cob]], [[mashed potatoes]], [[onion rings]], [[sweet potato pie]]s and a variety of flavors of [[ice cream]] for dessert.<ref name="qp">Tarek, Shams (ndg) [https://web.archive.org/web/20030311185937/http://www.queenspress.com/archives/restaurants/crownfriedchicken.htm "Restaurant Review: A Fast Food King With Many Choices"], ''Southeast Queens Press''</ref>

Many restaurant locations are in low-income and [[Crime in the United States|higher crime communities]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Vargas, Claudia|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-03-28/news/29354233_1_fu-hing-camden-officials-wren-ingram |title=Camden will try again to impose a curfew on late-night takeouts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065136/http://articles.philly.com/2011-03-28/news/29354233_1_fu-hing-camden-officials-wren-ingram |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=December 27, 2019 |url-status=dead |publisher=Philly.com}}</ref> serving from behind [[bulletproof glass]], especially at night. Some locations have added [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern dishes]] such as [[kebab]]s with rice to their menus,<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories12042008/enteres152800_32473.shtml |title=Fort Washington restaurant brings kabob to south county |date=December 4, 2008 |accessdate=November 24, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> but Kennedy's and Crown's specialties are the deep-fried chicken (described as "not too dry or too soggy").<ref name="qp"/> Chicken and food are quite often ordered [[a la carte]]. Not all dishes are available for takeout and delivery. Menus are usually posted on the walls with photographs.

Due to the tendency of these restaurants to appear in socioeconomically challenged locations, Kennedy, Crown, and New York Fried Chicken  are sometimes referred to disparagingly as "[[ghetto]] chicken".<ref>Smith, Andrew.

In 2008 one Kennedy Fried Chicken restaurant in [[Harlem, New York]] changed its name to "Obama Fried Chicken" in honor of the election of President [[Barack Obama]].<ref name="Fahim">{{cite news|date=April 3, 2009|title=Brooklyn Restaurant’s Name Hits a Sour Note|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Fahim, Kareem|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/nyregion/04chicken.html|accessdate=January 15, 2024}}</ref>

==Legal matters==
The restaurants are traditionally owned and operated mostly by [[Afghan American|Afghan-Americans]] but are not formally connected, although their concept, menus and prices are similar.<ref name="Kurutz">{{cite news|date=August 15, 2004|title=Chicken Little|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Kurutz, Steven |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E4DC153FF936A2575BC0A9629C8B63|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> The multitude of owners has caused problems for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in New York; since the 1990s Kentucky Fried Chicken has tried to enforce [[trademark]] rights against some of the Kennedy Fried Chicken restaurants, many of which used the initials "KFC", and have been known to decorate their restaurants in red and white colors similar to Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.

=== Trademark controversy ===
In 2005 Abdul Haye, an Afghan immigrant since 1989 and a resident of [[Whitestone, Queens]] in New York City, registered Kennedy Fried Chicken as a trademark. He has been attempting to enforce the trademark against other restaurants with mixed results.<ref name="Bilefsky">{{cite news|date=February 13, 2011|title=A Chicken War in New York, Where Afghans Rule the Roost|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Bilefsky, Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/nyregion/14chicken.html|accessdate=April 28, 2011|quote=I'm declaring war against all the Afghans in New York who have stolen my name and my idea.
