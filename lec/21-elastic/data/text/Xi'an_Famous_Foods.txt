==History==
Jason Wang serves as the company’s CEO and president. He and his family come from [[Xi'an]], [[Shaanxi]] one of the oldest cities in China with more than 3,100 years of history. Born in Xi’an, Wang reminisces about the food that his grandfather cooked when he was young. Once Wang and his family moved to the U.S., the yearning for home flavors inspired Wang and his father to make dishes with his grandfather’s secret sauce recipes.<ref name="Stern">{{cite news

Before Xi’an Famous Foods existed, Jason Wang’s father started a bubble tea shop, which sold food on the side, in [[Flushing, Queens]]. Meanwhile, Wang was in college at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], but came home during breaks to help his father in the shop.<ref>{{cite news

After Wang graduated in 2009 with a bachelor’s degree in business, he worked in corporate for a short time, but then decided to focus on co-founding his family food business with his father. From that moment, Wang and his father continued expanding their food business to Manhattan and Brooklyn, opening eight more shops.<ref>{{cite news

[[File:Lozupone xian.png|thumb|Storefront on [[Saint Marks Place]]]]
In late 2005, the original Xi’an Famous Foods opened in the basement of the Golden Mall in Flushing, Queens. In August 2009, two more shops opened, one in Flushing and one on [[East Broadway (Manhattan)|East Broadway]], but were both closed due to their limited space and facilities not conducive to the growing operations. In 2010, Xi’an Famous Foods brought their authentic Xi’an cuisine to Manhattan in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on [[8th Street / St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St. Marks Place]]. Following its success, another shop opened in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] ten months later. The company continued to expand rapidly.
