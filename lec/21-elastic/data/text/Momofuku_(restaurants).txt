Chang has written that the name "Momofuku" is "an indirect nod" to [[Momofuku Ando]], the [[Japanese people|Japanese]]-[[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] inventor of instant [[ramen]]. Chang has suggested it is not an accident that he chose a word that sounds similar to the curse word "[[motherfucker]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Chang|first=David|title=Momofuku|url=https://archive.org/details/momofuku00chan_723|url-access=limited|year=2009|publisher=Clarkson Potter|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-45195-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/momofuku00chan_723/page/n28 28]|edition=1st|author2=Stabile, Peter Meehan |author3=photographs by Gabriele }}</ref>

== History ==
With experience in restaurants in [[New York City]], Chef David Chang opened up his first restaurant in 2004, Momofuku Noodle Bar. It was influenced by his time spent working in Japan and visiting ramen shops.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/dining/2004-the-year-that-changed-how-we-dine.html |title=2004, the Year That Changed How We Dine |newspaper=New York Times |date=30 December 2013 |access-date=17 May 2014 |author=Gordinier, Jeff}}</ref> After about a year of trials, Noodle Bar took off as a success when the chefs began cooking what they felt like.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Chef on The Edge|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/24/080324fa_fact_macfarquhar|newspaper=The New Yorker |author=MacFarquhar, Larissa |date=July 24, 2008 |access-date=September 2, 2011}}</ref> Growing, Noodle Bar eventually moved up the street, and Momofuku Ko took over the space.

Momofuku Ssäm Bar opened after Noodle Bar and originally had the concept of an Asian-style burrito bar (''[[ssam]]'' is Korean for wrap).<ref>{{cite web|title=The I Chang|url=http://nymag.com/restaurants/features/26568/|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=January 12, 2007 |access-date=September 2, 2011}}</ref> After experiencing troubles, Chang and his cohorts decided to change the style of the menu, away from the burrito-centered cuisine. This change led Ssäm Bar to success, as it received two stars (eventually three) from ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Serious Strides, but Keeping Its Cool|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html?pagewanted=2&sq=bruni%20momofuku%20ssam%20bar&st=cse&scp=1 | newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=September 2, 2011|first=Frank|last=Bruni|date=December 3, 2008}}</ref>

The third restaurant to open was Momofuku Ko. Chang describes the idea behind Ko as a "cook-centric restaurant with just a few stools, a collaborative kitchen, and a constantly changing menu."<ref>{{cite book|last=Chang|first=David|title=Momofuku|url=https://archive.org/details/momofuku00chan_723|url-access=limited|year=2009|publisher=Clarkson Potter|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-45195-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/momofuku00chan_723/page/n125 126]|edition=1st|author2=Stabile, Peter Meehan |author3=photographs by Gabriele }}</ref> Má Pêche was the fourth restaurant to open and the first to open outside of the East Village neighborhood.

Doing office work for Ssäm Bar at the time, pastry chef [[Christina Tosi]] began the desserts program at the three Momofuku restaurants, first at Ssäm Bar, then Noodle Bar, and then Ko.<ref name="Tosi">{{cite book|last=Tosi|first=Christina|title=Momofuku Milk Bar|year=2011|publisher=Clarkson Potter|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-72049-8|edition=1st|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/momofukumilkbar00tosi_0}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
In March 2024, Momofuku filed with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to trademark the phrases "chili crunch" and "chile crunch".<ref name=":4">{{Cite news |last=Roberts |first=Nina |date=2024-04-04 |title=‘Trademark bully’: Momofuku turns up heat on others selling ‘chili crunch’ |url=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/04/chili-crunch-trademark-momofuku-david-chang |access-date=2024-04-04 |work=[[The Guardian]] |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> As of early April, the company has not been awarded the trademark.<ref name=":4" /> Coinciding with the filing, Momofuku began issuing [[cease and desist]] letters to a variety of businesses, most of which are small, using the phrases.<ref name=":4" /> This move was negatively received by a number of food businesses.<ref name=":4" /> In a statement to the LA Times, Momofuku argued that the trademark was not intended to stifle any competition surrounding the sauces, stating that "When we created our product, we wanted a name we could own and intentionally picked ‘Chili Crunch’ to further differentiate it from the broader chili crisp category."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-08 |title=Momofuku responds to chili crunch backlash: 'We wanted a name we could own' |url=https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2024-04-08/chili-crunch-chili-crisp-trademark-war-momofuku-fly-by-jing |access-date=2024-04-09 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> On April 12, Chang issued a public apology regarding the issue on his podcast, ''The Dave Chang Show'', stating that Momofuku had not intended to upset with their legal actions, and noted that Momofuku would no longer attempt to enforce the trademark. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-13 |title=David Chang issues apology over ‘chili crunch’ trademark controversy |url=https://www.today.com/food/news/david-chang-momofuku-chili-crunch-trademark-controversy-rcna146564 |access-date=2024-04-15 |website=TODAY.com |language=en}}</ref>
