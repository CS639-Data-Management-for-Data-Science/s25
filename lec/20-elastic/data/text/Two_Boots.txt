Each location has its own distinctive characteristics, incorporating elements of the neighborhood, with artist commissions for murals, mosaics, and sculptures to feature in an individual pizzeria. As well, each location has a unique menu item that pays homage to its community; for example, the Hogwallop pie in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn]] location was named after a character in the film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', played by Park Slope resident [[John Turturro]].<ref name="Hynum"/>
