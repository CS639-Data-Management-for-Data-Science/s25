{{Short description|New York City investment company}}
'''The Riese Organization''' ({{IPA|/ris/}}) is a privately-held investment company based in [[New York City]] that is heavily invested in real estate and in franchised fast food and casual dining restaurants in [[Manhattan]].

==History==

Irving and Murray Riese, two brothers born in [[Harlem]], opened their first restaurant, a [[luncheonette]] in [[midtown Manhattan]], in 1940, for about $8,500. Five years later, the brothers sold the luncheonette for $38,500, and they used the profit to start a business of [[flipping]] troubled restaurant properties after quickly refurbishing them. Murray told ''The New York Times'' in 1983 that they had bought and sold as many as 25 restaurants in one month.<ref name="nytimes-1983">{{cite news |last1=Hollie |first1=Pamela G. |title=THE FAMILY THAT FEEDS NEW YORK |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/business/the-family-that-feeds-new-york.html |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=The New York Times |date=October 30, 1983}}</ref> The brothers incorporated National Restaurants Management, Inc., to acquire and operate restaurants, after a court had ruled in 1953 that the Riese brothers were real estate brokers, and that they could not claim lower [[capital gains tax]] rates on restaurants that they had held for less than three years.<ref name="histories">{{cite book |last1=Pederson |first1=Jay P. |title=International directory of company histories, Vol. 38 |publisher=St. James Press |isbn=9781558626799 |pages=385–388 |edition=2001 |url=https://archive.org/embed/internationaldir0038unse |access-date=November 20, 2023}}</ref>

In 1972, the Riese Organization had about 150 restaurants in its portfolio, making it the United States's largest privately-owned restaurant business. By 1989, the company had about 300 restaurants.<ref name="histories" />

The Riese Organization is credited with introducing the [[food court]] concept to New York in the 1980s. In 1982, [[Marriott Corporation]], which owned the [[Roy Rogers Restaurants|Roy Rogers restaurant chain]], sued Riese for planning to colocate a Roy Rogers with a [[Pizza Hut]] and a [[Häagen-Dazs]] ice cream shop in one [[Times Square]] location; after the Riese family won, they opened additional food courts with as many as eight brands in one location.<ref name="nytimes-1995" />  By the late 1980s, the Riese Organization had licenses to run operations for 28 franchises in New York City, most of them on an exclusive basis.<ref name="histories" />

===Decline and bankruptcy===

The company took a $140 million loan from the [[MUFG Bank|Bank of Tokyo–Mitsubishi Trust Company]], with 14 properties as collateral; during the 1990s, the company sold properties, closed restaurants, and changed its business strategy to improve profitability. National Restaurants Management filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1999; the Riese Organization, as a subsidiary, was not affected, and  reorganization in 2000 placed National Restaurants under the Riese Organization.<ref name="histories" /><ref name="nrn-2000">{{cite news |last1=Frumkin |first1=Paul |title=Riese exits Chap. 11 |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/229289385 |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=Nation's Restaurant News |issue=34 |date=August 21, 2000 |pages=4,6 |id={{ProQuest|229289385}} |language=en}}</ref>

===Pivot to casual dining===

In 2013, Dennis Riese told ''[[Crain's New York Business]]'' that his company "will be much less known for fast food," by opening more casual dining eateries with table service. At that time, the company had about 75 restaurants, and owned 25 buildings, collectively generating $100 million in annual revenue. About 60 of the company's restaurants, contributing about one-third of Riese's revenue, were fast food restaurants; Dennis told ''Crain's'' that he did not intend to increase his fast food holdings.<ref name="crains-2013">{{cite news |last1=Fickenscher |first1=Lisa |title=Fast-food king no more |url=https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130113/HOSPITALITY_TOURISM/301139966/fast-food-king-no-more |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=Crain's New York Business |date=January 12, 2013}}</ref>

Dennis Riese said in 2019 that he intends to wind down his company’s restaurant business due to rising wages, changing labor laws, and changes in the retail landscape. He announced an investment in Loudpack, a [[recreational marijuana]] business based in California, which he sees as an opportunity for growth.<ref name="rew-2019">{{cite news |last1=O'Flanagan |first1=Linda |title=Riese funds joint ventures as Cuomo backs cannabis |url=https://rew-online.com/riese-funds-joint-ventures-as-cuomo-backs-cannabis/ |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=Real Estate Weekly |date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>

==Legal issues==

Although Riese's food court restaurants took and fulfilled orders from different retail units, sometimes on separate floors of a building, they had a centralized kitchen to reduce operating costs. This violated the terms of many franchise agreements, although the Rieses used their wealth and real estate holdings to exert leverage over brand owners. In the 1990s, Riese took the unusual step of cobranding its food courts and franchised restaurants with "Riese Restaurants" on signage, prompting an unsuccessful lawsuit from [[T.G.I. Friday's]] for violating Friday's franchise agreement.<ref name="histories" />

In 1998, the front page of the ''[[New York Post]]'' showed a Riese-owned [[Dunkin' Donuts]] franchise infested with rats, one of which was eating a [[coconut doughnut]].<ref name="nytimes-2003-05">{{cite news |last1=Newman |first1=Andy |title=Not With Our Doughnuts, Chain Says to a Franchisee |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/24/nyregion/not-with-our-doughnuts-chain-says-to-a-franchisee.html |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=The New York Times |date=May 24, 2003}}</ref> This caused a public relations crisis for Riese and Dunkin', which resulted in lawsuits and the termination of the franchise agreement.<ref name="nytimes-1999-lawsuit">{{cite news |last1=Weiser |first1=Benjamin |title=Dunkin' Donuts Sues Shop Owner Over Mice |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/05/nyregion/dunkin-donuts-sues-shop-owner-over-mice.html |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=The New York Times |date=January 5, 1999}}</ref> In 2009, Riese closed its 12 Dunkin' restaurants and one Dunkin' food cart, and three days later, all 13 locations reopened as the first [[Tim Hortons]] locations in New York City.<ref name="nbcnewyork-2009">{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Scott |title=Baker's Dozen of Dunkin Donuts Changing Stripes |url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/local/bakers-dozen-of-dunkin-donuts-becoming-tim-hortons/1845388/ |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=NBC New York |date=July 10, 2009}}</ref>

Between 1996 and 1999, the Riese Organization had a labor dispute with workers represented by Local 100 of the [[Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union]]. The union criticized Riese's practice of closing a restaurant after it became unionized, laying off all staff, and then reopening a non-union restaurant at the same location. Dennis Riese defended the practice, saying that his company was replacing restaurants that had gone out of style.<ref name="nytimes-1999-union">{{cite news |last1=Greenhouse |first1=Steven |title=Riese and Restaurant Union Accept Contract After 3 Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/25/nyregion/riese-and-restaurant-union-accept-contract-after-3-years.html |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=The New York Times |date=January 25, 1999}}</ref>

In 2015, former staff members of a T.G.I. Friday's restaurant owned by Riese sued the company, alleging racial discrimination. Riese closed a Friday's location on 34th Street whose service staff was mostly Black, and hired only one of the Black workers when they opened another Friday's location one block away. The lawsuit alleged that managers referred to the former restaurant and its dark-skinned staffers in derogatory ways.<ref name="pix11-2015">{{cite news |last1=Behr |first1=Kristina |title=Former TGI Fridays employees sue company over racist hiring practices |url=https://pix11.com/news/local-news/manhattan/former-tgi-fridays-employees-sue-company-over-racist-hiring-practices/ |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=PIX11 |date=March 1, 2015}}</ref>

The Riese Organization closed its web site in 2017 out of concerns that it was not compliant with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], which Dennis Riese said might prompt a lawsuit.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Olson |first1=Walter |title=NYC restaurant chain takes down website to avoid accessibility suits |url=https://www.overlawyered.com/2018/02/nyc-eatery-chain-takes-website-avoid-accessibility-suits/ |access-date=November 20, 2023 |work=Overlawyered |date=February 3, 2018}}</ref>

==Restaurant brands==

Most of the Riese Organization's restaurants have historically been [[chain restaurant]]s, to appeal to tourists who would recognize a familiar name.<ref name="nytimes-1983"/> The company has operated franchises of [[T.G.I. Friday's]], [[Houlihan's]], [[Beefsteak Charlie's]], [[Tim Hortons]], [[Chock full o'Nuts]] lunch counters, [[Roy Rogers Restaurants|Roy Rogers restaurants]], [[Pizza Hut]], and [[KFC]]. The company has also developed its own restaurant brands, including [[Tad's Steaks]], Charley O's, Martini's, and Tequilaville.

The company purchased the [[Lindy's]] name, trading on the nostalgia of the former restaurant.<ref name="nyt-rev">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/arts/times-square-a-la-mode.html?pagewanted=all | title= Times Square a la Mode | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=Eric | last=Asimov | date= August 16, 1996}}("Lindy's, of course, still exists, but not in its original form. The name is owned by the Riese organization, which foreshadowed the current theme craze with its own nostalgic revival.")</ref> The company also owned [[Lüchow's]] and four [[Longchamps (restaurant chain)|Longchamps restaurants]].<ref name="tosell">Hammer, Alexander R.
